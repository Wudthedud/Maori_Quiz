TO DO
 2. Divide functions into classes (time dependent)
 3. Create quiz for days of the week, easy - ask for numbers, medium - ask for day with names, hard - multi choice
 4. Finish main program, add option to retry the game, ask if they want to see the scoreboard
 5. Provide feedback after each round, find a way to make questions look better instead of block of text
